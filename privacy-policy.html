        <p>Our Documentation Website and Mobile Application are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

        <h2>Mobile Application Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>This section specifically addresses privacy practices for the Entertainment Management App mobile application:</p>
        
        <h3>Data Collection in the App</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Automatic Data Collection:</strong> Our mobile application does not automatically collect or transmit any personal information or usage data from your device.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Initiated Communications:</strong> The app will only send information when you explicitly choose to submit a bug report, support ticket, or feature request. In those cases, only the information you provide in your submission will be transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics or tracking tools in our mobile application.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your data is primarily stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud Backup:</strong> The app uses Apple's iCloud to back up your data if you have iCloud enabled on your device. This backup process is controlled by you through your device settings and Apple's iCloud service. We do not have direct access to your iCloud data.</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You maintain control over your data backup preferences through your device's iCloud settings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data Security in the App</h3>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data within our application. However, the security of data stored on your device and in iCloud is also dependent on your device security settings and Apple's iCloud security.</p>
        
        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The mobile application may contain integrations with third-party services (such as Apple's iCloud). Your use of these services is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service.</p>
        
        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        
        <p>Our Documentation Website may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites you visit.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice on our website or by other means as required by applicable law. Your continued use of the website after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        
        <h3>Cookie Preferences</h3>
        <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our website.</p>
        
        <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
        <p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal. We currently do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
        
        <h3>Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These might include rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided below.</p>
